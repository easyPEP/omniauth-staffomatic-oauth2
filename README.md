# OmniAuth Staffomatic

Staffomatic OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-staffomatic-oauth2'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Staffomatic` is simply a Rack middleware. Read [the OmniAuth 1.0 docs](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) for detailed instructions.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :Staffomatic, ENV['STAFFOMATIC_API_KEY'], ENV['STAFFOMATIC_SHARED_SECRET']
end
```

## Configuring

You can configure the scope, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See [the Staffomatic API docs](http://docs.staffomatic.com/api/tutorials/oauth) for a full list of available permissions.

* `setup`: A lambda which dynamically sets the `site`. You must initiate the OmniAuth process by passing in a `shop` query parameter of the shop you're requesting permissions for. Ex. http://myapp.com/auth/staffomatic?shop=example.staffomatic.com

For example, to request `read_users`, `read_shifts` and `write_applications` permissions and display the authentication page:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :Staffomatic, ENV['STAFFOMATIC_API_KEY'], ENV['STAFFOMATIC_SHARED_SECRET'],
            :scope => 'read_users,read_shifts,write_spplications',
            :setup => lambda { |env| params = Rack::Utils.parse_query(env['QUERY_STRING'])
                                     env['omniauth.strategy'].options[:client_options][:site] = "https://#{params['shop']}" }
end
```

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'staffomatic',
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'asdk2399ewjoijc2309', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you store and use to authenticate API requests
  }
}
```
